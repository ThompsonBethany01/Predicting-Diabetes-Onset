## About the Project
### Goals
The major goal of this project is to create a machine learning model that can predict a patient having diabetes or not. The model will base this on other diagnostic measures in the data, such as BMI and age. The data sample is for female patients at least 21 years of age or older with Pima Indian heritage.
### Background
### Deliverables
- Jupyter notebook with full analysis process
- Presentation on key insights and model performance
